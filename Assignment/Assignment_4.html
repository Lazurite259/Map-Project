TUTORIAL WILL BE TO WATCH FUNCTION VIDEOS AND EXPLAIN HOW THE NUMS EXAMPLE WORKS!

Instructions 

Goals accomplished here:

1. Create and Style a Button with user interaction. 
2. Use a do/while statement to control the behavior of map 
3. Create a program with several functions. Just follow your nose!
4. Create 3 cities as objects that contain the following information as properties of an object: Geographic Coordinates (with square brackets), Population, and Area. 
5. Create a function that will calculate population density for each city you chose using an if and else statement. The density will depend on what unit the user picked in the prompt.
6. You'll be using if and else statements to help your program handle the user input of km or miles

Help: 

The first part is already done for you. I created the map the center, as well as the button/button behavior. I created the variable units while will store the choice of the user for miles or km. We will want to take this information with us. You will pass it as an argument to the Map Cities function signature. I created this for you as well. 

In the map cities function you will want to do the following: Create three variables in the map cities function. One for each cities density. You will pass 3 bits of information along for each density variable to a new function, which you should call calcPopDensity - the population, area, and units, which you took from before. 

So you should have three variables in which you pass three different arguments to the same calcPopDensity function body. Since you can use the same function as many times as you want with different bits of information you only need to state three parameters in your function body - something like pop, area, and units.

In this function body create an if else statement based on what unit the user picked (represented by unit) In one case you should calculate density for miles in another density for km (if km... {} else if...)

Return the different possibilities to the variable from which it was sent. The final step is to create the markers and popups in the MapCities function body. 

You should create two variables for each city - one that governs the popup and one that creates the marker.

Mine look like this...

var bingPopup = "<b>" + "Binghamton" + "</b><br>" +
               "<b>Density</b>: "+bingDensity.toLocaleString()+" people per sq " + units;
            var bingMarker =
                L.marker(Binghamton.coord)
               .addTo(map)
               .bindPopup(bingPopup);

Let me explain how this works. 

The popup is just the text. Notice the b tags. We put quotes around them and then use the plus sign to link different elements together. br only needs to appear once - this will create a line break. Density is the word Density - a string, bingDensity is the variable density that we calculated for each city using the calcPopDensity function. People per sq mile is a a string and the units refer to the km or miles decision the user made in the prompt. 

We really don't need to store the marker values but it makes us easy to undestand what is going on. We use L.marker to create the Leaflet marker with the coordinates from the object you created. We use the addTo method to make it appear and finally we add the popup we created above.

        // Part I For the assignment this week please turn in the solution from last week (Map Cities function) 

        // 1. Use arrays instead of objects to structure your data 
        // 2. Use a for loop strucutre to make your program more efficient. 

        // part 2 

        // Add 2 user interactivity map methods and 2 user interactivity marker methods from Leaflet to a three city marker map (you can use circles as well).

        // For the A 

        // Create a map in which the user creates a marker through a click 
        // remove the marker when user clicks again 
        // Create a 'drag end' event on this marker
        // Make the marker dissapear when the user stops dragging.
